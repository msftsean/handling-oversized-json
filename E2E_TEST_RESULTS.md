## Recommendations for Customer Demo

1. **Start with Supervisor Dashboard** - Shows real-time filtering and summarization
2. **Show Dispatcher Context** - Demonstrates location-based historical queries
3. **Run Compliance Analysis** - Highlight context-varying pattern benefits for pattern detection
4. **Share Documentation** - Reference REFACTORED_FIVE_STEP_APPROACH.md for implementation details
5. **Discuss Model Drift** - Walk through MODEL_DRIFT_MONITORING.md for long-term quality assurance

---

## Summary

The incident data processing pipeline is fully implemented, tested, and documented. All 3 use cases are production-ready with appropriate performance characteristics. The code includes comprehensive error handling, async patterns, and Azure authentication. Context-varying chunking patterns are implemented for improved accuracy on pattern detection tasks. The system is ready for customer deployment and demonstration.
